# CI/CD Pipeline 
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery Pipeline 

#### SDLC 
Software development life cycle based on:
-plan/design
-develop
-test
-deploy

#### Problems in traditional SD;C
- Scale and complexity	
	- Function
	- Architecture 
	- Infrastructure
	- Developer
	- Operations
- Manual and slow processes
- Broken communication
- Human errors
-

#### DevOps in SDLC
- DevOps come to help modern SDLC - Agile
	- Collaboration 
	- Automation

#### DevOps Lifecycle Stages 
- Continuous Development 
- Continuous Testing 
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery/Deployment 
- Continuous Monitoring 

#### CI - Continuous Integration
Continous Integration(CD) is the practice of merging all developers workng copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
- Development
- Testing
- Integration 

Continuous deployment - goes live in front of the users so if something goes wrong then it will appear wrong live

#### Why CI/CD Matters?
- reduce costs
- faster release rate
- smaller code changes
- fault isolations 
- more test reliability 
- increase team transparency and accountability 
- easy maintenance and updates 

#### Conclusion

DevOps helps
- culture
- people.teams 
- collaboration
- principles
